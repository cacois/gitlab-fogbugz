# 0.0.4 / 2012-07-16
* Use separate CLI options due Sinatra refactoring

# 0.0.3 / 2012-07-15
* Make gitlab-fogbugz-server actually work when installed as gem
* Fix tests in Ruby 1.9.2 (did work in 1.8 and 1.9.3)

# 0.0.2 / 2012-07-12
* Switched from curl to programmatically use the FogBugz API via ruby-fogbugz
  The initial reason to use curl were Ruby 1.8 SSL issues; just hope they've
  been fixed in the last four years.

# 0.0.1 / 2012-07-12
* Forked from github-fogbugz
* First adaption to work with GitLiab
